# Simulation of bacterias evolving resistance over time

![alt tag](https://github.com/Wheele9/Petrdish-simulation/blob/master/images/mutant.png)

## Synopsis

I watched this video, where they put a weak bacteria at the edge of a giant petri dish,
after 11 days the bacteria evolved into something which was able to survive the conditions
of high antibiotics density.

## Code Example

You can create your own petri dish, with different size, and a antibiotics dispersion, you can
tune the parameters of the virus, such as lifespan, mutability, starting resistance and see, that in your case it spreads the whole petri dish, or dies once.

## Motivation

I created this project for fun, fork it, play with it
